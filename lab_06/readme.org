* Lab_06- Debugging "buggy.cpp"
Using ddd, I set a breakpoint after the test for the first task and saw that the
test returned 0 for both max_val and max_i. This indicated that the for loop
(which was designed to modify both variables) was not being called, 
subsequently showing that there was something wrong with the for loop call 
condition. Looking at the call revealed that the check "i > CAPACITY" never
returned true, so turning it into "i < CAPACITY" made the call work as
intented.
